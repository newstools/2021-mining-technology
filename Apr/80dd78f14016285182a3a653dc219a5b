Swedish mining firm Boliden plans to invest $149m (Skr1.25bn) to expand the Kristineberg mine towards the Rävliden mineralisation zone. The proposed expansion is expected to help increase milled volumes in the Boliden area to 1.8 million tonnes (Mt) when operational in 2023. Boliden said that most of the investment, however, is subject to the approval of the Swedish Land and Environment Court for increased production at the Kristineberg mine. Boliden mines president Stefan Romedahl said: “This is a very important step in future-proofing the entire Boliden area. “The expansion and modernisation of the mine will take place in several stages, during which, we will, of course, also evaluate opportunities for employing fossil-free technology. In parallel, we will continue with exploration efforts in the area.” The firm intends to make preparatory investments in infrastructure and water treatment, among other activities. Upon securing approval, the company plans to undertake work on a new ramp and crushing station at the Kristineberg mine. In a press statement, Boliden said: “A completed expansion will mean, in addition to increased mine production, that the life of the Kristineberg mine will be extended and that capacity utilisation in the Boliden area’s concentrator will be improved.” According to the estimates, the Rävliden deposit has 8.4Mt of inferred and indicated mineral resources with a scope of additional reserves. The Boliden area is also home to the Renström and Kankberg underground mines. In addition, it comprises a concentrator and leaching plant for gold and tellurium production.
