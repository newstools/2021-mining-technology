Artificial intelligence is an area which has seen rapid growth across a variety of industries in recent years – not least among mining industry operations and technologies companies. Figures show that the number of new artificial intelligence roles being advertised for these companies has increased in recent months – with firms across the industry looking to expand their capabilities. The number of newly advertised roles stood at 487 in Q1 2021. That’s up from 393 in Q4 2020 but down from from 554 in Q3 2020. The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisments are then classified thematically. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include artificial intelligence, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. Where are companies hiring for artificial intelligence careers in mining? Looking across key mining industry operations and technologies companies tracked by GlobalData, the US is currently seeing the largest number of artificial intelligence job advertisisments. Last quarter the country saw 147 advertisements - down from 168 in Q4 2020 and 337 in Q3 2020. On a city level, Komatsu (Japan) had the most newly advertised artificial intelligence roles in Q1 2021 with 111, followed by Advance, (US) with 19, and Peoria, (US) with 18. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Where is seeing the most growth for artificial intelligence roles in mining? The biggest growth area has been in Japan - which saw zero job adverts for artificial intelligence in Q4 2020, increasing to 111 in Q1 2021. In terms of cities, firms are increasing artificial intelligence hires in Pune - with nine roles in the latest quarter - up from zero in the previous one. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Training personnel to use machinery such shotcrete sprayers can be tricky. Ultimately, we need to find a way to provide efficient, realistic training without putting people in danger or risking damage to expensive machinery. Normet offers the solutions with its virtual reality sprayed concrete training. This advanced software does more than mimic the application, it calculates everything that comes through the nozzle, with real adjustable properties and behaviour of sprayed concrete mix.
