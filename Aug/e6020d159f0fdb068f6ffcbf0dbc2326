Resource company TerraCom has extended the operational life of the Blair Athol (BA) coal mine in Queensland, Australia, by approximately ten years. The move follows an update to the BA Coal Reserve. Deswik Mining Consultants (Australia) completed a revised joint ore reserves committee (JORC) assessment of the Blair Athol mine operation. According to the assessment, the mine is estimated to have JORC Marketable Reserves of 19.5 million tonnes (Mt), as of 30 June 2021. Based on a sales profile of 2Mt, the project’s operational life has been extended to a further ten years. TerraCom said that the coal reserves estimate at the mine have been reported in compliance with the standards outlined in the 2012 Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code) edition. TerraCom executive chairman Craig Ransley said: “This latest JORC Reserve result means that the Blair Athol operation will effectively be able to operate for 14 years under TerraCom ownership (since the acquisition in May 2017). “Blair Athol has already contributed significantly to the TerraCom group and we look forward to a further ten years contribution from the operation.” TerraCom restarted operations at the Blair Athol Coal Mine following its acquisition from Rio Tinto in 2017. The mine’s production was suspended in 2012 after Rio Tinto put the mine under care and maintenance. Since the restart, the mine has been producing up to 3Mtpa of high-quality thermal coal for exports into Asian markets.
