Industrial automation is one of these topics - companies that excel and invest in these areas are thought to be better prepared for the future business landscape and better equipped to survive unforeseen challenges. To assess whether industrial automation is featuring more in the summaries and strategies of companies in the mining industry, two measures were calculated. Firstly, we looked at the percentage of companies which have mentioned industrial automation at least once in filings during the past twelve months – this was 79% compared to 56% in 2016. Secondly, we calculated the percentage of total analysed sentences that referred to industrial automation. Of the 50 biggest employers in the mining industry, Epiroc AB was the company which referred to industrial automation the most between July 2020 and June 2021. GlobalData identified 46 industrial automation-related sentences in the Sweden-based company's filings – 1% of all sentences. Sandvik AB mentioned industrial automation the second most – the issue was referred to in 0.5% of sentences in the company's filings. Other top employers with high industrial automation mentions included Honeywell International Inc, Komatsu Ltd, and Atlas Copco AB.

This analysis provides an approximate indication of which companies are focusing on industrial automation and how important the issue is considered within the mining industry, but it also has limitations and should be interpreted carefully. For example, a company mentioning industrial automation more regularly is not necessarily proof that they are utilising new techniques or prioritising the issue, nor does it indicate whether the company's ventures into industrial automation have been successes or failures. In the last quarter, companies in the mining industry based in Eastern Europe were most likely to mention industrial automation with 0.18% of sentences in company filings referring to the issue. In contrast, companies with their headquarters in Africa mentioned industrial automation in just 0.05% of sentences. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Remote and Hazardous Medical, Health and Emergency Services Industrial Valves for the Mining Industry Geotechnical Support and Consultancy for Mining Projects
