Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include big data, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was Australia, which saw 7.3% of all big data job adverts in the three months ending June last year, increasing to 9.8% in the three months ending September this year. That was followed by Japan (up 2.2 percentage points), China (up 1.2), and the United Kingdom (up 0.9). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for big data roles in the mining industry is the United States which saw 48% of all roles in the three months ending September.
