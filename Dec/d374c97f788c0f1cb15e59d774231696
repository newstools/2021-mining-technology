Europe was the fastest growing region for machine learning hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending October. The number of roles in Europe made up 10.2% of total machine learning jobs – up from 1.4% in the same quarter last year. That was followed by Asia-Pacific, which saw a 7.4 year-on-year percentage point change in machine learning roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include machine learning, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was India, which saw 8.8% of all machine learning job adverts in the three months ending October last year, increasing to 21.5% in the three months ending October this year. That was followed by Canada (up 0.8 percentage points), the UK (up 0.1), and Mexico (up -0.5). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for machine learning roles in the mining industry is the US which saw 48.8% of all roles in the three months ending October. Some 11% of all mining industry machine learning roles were advertised in Erie (US) in the three months ending October – more than any other city. That was followed by Advance (US) with 11%, Milwaukee (US) with 7.7%, and Portland (US) with 3.6%. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Methodology: GlobalData’s unique Job analytics enables understanding of hiring trends, strategies, and predictive signals across sectors, themes, companies, and geographies.
