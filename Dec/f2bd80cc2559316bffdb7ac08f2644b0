Research and innovation in artificial intelligence in the mining industry operations and technologies sector is on the rise. The most recent figures show that the number of AI patent applications in the industry stood at 37 in the three months ending September – up from 34 over the same period last year. Figures for patent grants related to AI followed a different pattern to filings – growing from 26 in the three months ending September last year to 14 this year. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track patent filings and grants from official offices around the world. Using textual analysis, as well as official patent classifications, these patents are grouped into key thematic areas, and linked to key companies across various industries. AI is one of the key areas tracked by GlobalData. It has been identified as being a key disruptive force facing companies in the coming years, and is one of the areas that companies investing resources in now are expected to reap rewards from. The figures also provide an insight into the largest innovators in the sector. Honeywell International Inc was the top artificial intelligence innovator in the mining industry operations and technologies sector in the last quarter. The company, which has its headquarters in the United States, filed 63 AI related patents in the three months ending September. That was up from 57 over the same period last year. It was followed by the United States based Caterpillar Inc with eight AI patent applications, South Korea based POSCO (3 applications), and Germany based ThyssenKrupp AG (3 applications). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Honeywell International Inc has recently ramped up R&D in artificial intelligence. It saw growth of 9.5% in related patent applications in the three months ending September compared to the same period last year - the highest percentage growth out of all companies tracked with more than 10 quarterly patents in the mining industry operations and technologies sector.
