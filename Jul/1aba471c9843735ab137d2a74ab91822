Big data is an area which has seen rapid growth across a variety of industries in recent years – not least among mining industry operations and technologies companies. Figures show that the number of new big data roles being advertised for these companies has increased in recent months – with firms across the industry looking to expand their capabilities. The number of newly advertised roles stood at 361 in Q1 2021. That’s up from 277 in Q4 2020 but down from from 435 in Q3 2020. The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisments are then classified thematically. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries.
