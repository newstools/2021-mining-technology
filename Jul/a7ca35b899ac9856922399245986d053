The Ontario Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines (MENDM) in Canada has granted a mineral exploration permit to McLaren Resources for the Kerrs gold property. The permit for the 775ha Kerrs gold property, which is located in the prolific Timmins Gold District of north-eastern Ontario, has been issued for an initial three-year term. McLaren now plans to undertake various surface exploration activities, including line-cutting, geological and geophysical surveys and diamond drilling on the property. The firm is anticipated to complete initial data compilation and field studies on the Kerrs property during mid-2021. McLaren is also seeking an exploration permit from MENDM for its 100%-owned McCool gold property, which is held under one Ontario Mining Lease consisting of surface and mining rights. The Kerrs and 275ha McCool gold properties were acquired by McLaren from Newmont last year. This was agreed in exchange for a four-year option on McLaren’s Augdome gold property. Covering an area of 408ha, the Augdome property is located in Tisdale and Whitney Townships immediately east of the Newmont-owned Dome Mine. The Kerrs and McCool properties are located within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt along the Destor-Porcupine Deformation Zone, which is claimed to host several gold deposits. McLaren said that these two properties are located near several gold mines and development projects that are situated along Hwy 101 east of Timmins. Moreover, McLaren holds a 100% stake in the Blue Quartz Gold Mine, a past-producing property located approximately 22km west of the McCool property.
