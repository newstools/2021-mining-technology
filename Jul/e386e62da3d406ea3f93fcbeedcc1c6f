Thiess has been selected by MACH Energy as the preferred mining services contractor for the Mount Pleasant operation in Australia. Planned to be effective in April 2022, the contract is expected to be worth around $695.6m (A$925m) over a period of 4.5 years. Located in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, the Mount Pleasant greenfield open cut coal mine is estimated to have recoverable reserves of 474 million tonnes (Mt). Subject to contract finalisation, Thiess will provide full scope mining services, including drill and blast, load and haul, and mining and run of mine rehandling services. The contract will also include equipment maintenance and progressive rehabilitation at the mine. In a press statement, Thiess said: “Subject to execution, Thiess will continue to draw on local businesses for the provision of goods and services to support the mine and is committed to attracting and retaining a diverse, local workforce.” Thiess Australia executive general manager Shaun Newberry said: “We are pleased to continue building on our strong relationship with MACH Energy and on positively contributing to the local economy.” Thiess was earlier contracted to carry out complete mining operations at Mount Pleasant until this year. The scope of work included mine planning and engineering. Following a mobilisation period, the firm commenced mining at the Mount Pleasant project in November 2017. Thiess is currently responsible for full mining service as well as boosting Mount Pleasant’s production to 10.5 million run-of-mine (ROM) tonnes per annum.
