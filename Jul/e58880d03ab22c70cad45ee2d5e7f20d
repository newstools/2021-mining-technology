Teck Resources Ltd and Sibanye Stillwater Ltd are leading the way for artificial intelligence investment among top mining companies according to our analysis of a range of GlobalData data. Artificial intelligence has become one of the key themes in the mining sector of late, with companies hiring for increasingly more roles, making more deals, registering more patents and mentioning it more often in company filings. These themes, of which artificial intelligence is one, are best thought of as “any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night”, and by tracking and combining them, it becomes possible to ascertain which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels. According to GlobalData analysis, Teck Resources Ltd is one of the artificial intelligence leaders in a list of high-revenue companies in the mining industry, having advertised for 55 positions in artificial intelligence, made zero deals related to the field, filed zero patents and mentioned artificial intelligence two times in company filings between January 2020 and June 2021. Our analysis classified zero companies as Most Valuable Players – or MVPs – due to their high number of new jobs, deals, patents and company filings mentions in the field of artificial intelligence. An additional five companies are classified as Market Leaders and one are Average Players. Six more companies are classified as Late Movers due to their relatively lower levels of jobs, deals, patents and company filings in artificial intelligence. For the purpose of this analysis, we’ve ranked top companies in the mining sector on each of the four metrics relating to artificial intelligence: jobs, deals, patents and company filings. The best-performing companies – the ones ranked at the top across all or most metrics – were categorised as MVPs while the worst performers – companies ranked at the bottom of most indicators – were classified as Late Movers. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Anglo American Plc is spearheading the artificial intelligence hiring race, advertising for 70 new jobs between January 2020 and June 2021.
