Global commodities trader Trafigura and Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala are reportedly planning to sell their Spanish copper miner Minas de Aguas Teñidas (MATSA). A producer of copper and polymetallic ore on the Iberian Pyrite Belt, MATSA is planned to be divested in a deal that is led by investment banks UBS and Bank of Montreal (BMO). The potential deal is expected to generate up to $2bn, Reuters reported citing four banking sources as saying. The partners have set a deadline by the end of the week to submit initial offers from potential buyers. Citing one of the sources, the news agency said that Canada-based Lundin Mining, Hudbay Minerals and Australian miner South32 are among companies that could consider the acquisition of the Spanish miner. MATSA owns and operates three mines in the province of Huelva, notably the Aguas Teñidas and Magdalena mines in Almonaster la Real, as well as the Sotiel mine in the province of Huelva. The business is involved in the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits, as well as the processing of mineral ores at the company’s facilities in the Almonaster la Real municipality. The processing plant has a capacity of more than 4.4Mtpa of copper and polymetallic ore. Last year, MATSA reported production of more than 300,000t of copper concentrate – partially processed copper ore.
