Australia-based Ramelius Resources has commenced mining operations at the Tampia gold mine located near Narembeen, Western Australia. The first high-grade ore, which has been mined from the North Pit of the Tampia mine, is planned to be dispatched to the Edna May processing facility early next month. The latest move follows the start of open-pit mining at the Tampia project in April. Ramelius is planning to mine the higher-grade Mace and South Pit areas at the project, which is expected to produce approximately 490,000oz of gold over six years of the initial mine life. Ramelius managing director Mark Zeptner said: “We are pleased to have commenced the mining of high-grade ore from our Tampia gold mine on schedule with our published mine plan. “This is the culmination of the efforts of many employees, contractors, members of the local community and the Shires of Narembeen, Merredin & Westonia. “Gold from Tampia will represent a significant proportion of our FY2022 production target and be our first new mine in the Western Australian wheatbelt, where we believe we will deliver significant returns for all stakeholders.” The company acquired the Tampia gold project, which comprises two mining leases and nine exploration licences, in late 2018 / early 2019. Earlier this year, Ramelius Resources awarded a contract to MACA to provide open-pit mining services at the Tampia project. The scope of work includes load and haul, and drill and blast services.
