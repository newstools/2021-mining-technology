Canada-based Aya Gold & Silver has received seven new exploration permits within its properties in the Zgounder Regional and Azegour areas in Morocco. The permits from Morocco’s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Environment increases the firm’s total land position by 40% within the properties. Aya said that the permits would consolidate its land position within the ‘highly prospective’ Anti-Atlas region. The company secured five permits for a known copper-gold-silver-bearing area within the prolific Zgounder Regional area, increasing its exploration land holdings to 168km². Situated on the western flank of the Sirwa Massif of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, these permits host historically mapped copper, gold, silver, lead and zinc occurrences. The Zgounder Regional area is expected to offer significant mineral potential, based on high-grade silver results of recent core drill programmes. Additionally, the firm secured two permits in the Azegour property, located 80km south-southwest of Marrakech. It increases the firm’s exploration land coverage by 29km². Located directly adjacent to the Azegour granite intrusion, these two permits host historical copper, lead and zinc occurrences. Aya Gold & Silver president and CEO Benoit La Salle said: “We are excited to be adding these seven new permits, which materially increase our land holdings adjacent to existing mapped development projects and strengthen our mining commitment in Morocco. “These acquisitions enable us to leverage our existing regional knowledge and infrastructure to identify potential geological showings that can ultimately be drilled up to grow our resource base and enhance shareholder value for all stakeholders.” The company plans to start exploration work on the new permits in the coming months.
