Rio Tinto has awarded a $46m (A$60m) contract to GenusPlus Group to provide power installation for the Kangaroo Hill bulk supply substation in Dampier, Western Australia. The infrastructure is aimed at supporting Rio Tinto’s assets in Pilbara. As per the contract, GenusPlus’ wholly owned subsidiary Powerlines Plus will design and build a 15km dual-circuit 220kV transmission line between Karratha and Dampier. It will also construct a 220/33kV substation at Kangaroo Hill and undertake modification works at the Yurralyi Maya power station and Dampier bulk substation. The firm will also be responsible for the construction of new 33kV infrastructure and the deconstruction of redundant 220kV and 33kV infrastructure. Work is scheduled to commence in June 2021 with completion planned in approximately 22 months. GenusPlus managing director David Riches said: “We are pleased to secure the Kangaroo Hill contract and continue to build on our long relationship with Rio Tinto. “We continue to be on track to deliver on our Prospectus forecasts and continue to build a strong order book for FY22.” In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, Rio Tinto owns 16 mines, four independent port terminals, a 1,700km rail network and related infrastructure. The firm reported 333 million tonnes of iron ore production last year from its Pilbara iron ore operations, which employ 13,600 workers. Earlier this year, Rio Tinto signed a farm-in and joint venture agreement with Tali Resources to acquire the latter’s stake in five exploration prospective copper-gold tenements in Western Australia.
