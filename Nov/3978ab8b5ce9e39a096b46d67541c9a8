South & Central America was the fastest growing region for Internet of Things (IoT) hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending August.

That was followed by Asia-Pacific, which saw a 1.9 year-on-year percentage point change in IoT roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include internet of things, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was Australia, which saw 3.5 per cent of all IoT job adverts in the three months ending May last year, increasing to 8.7 per cent in the three months ending August this year. That was followed by Brazil (up 4.8 percentage points), Mexico (up 3.2), and the United Kingdom (up 2.7). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for IoT roles in the mining industry is the United States which saw 34.6 per cent of all roles in the three months ending August. Some 11.2 per cent of all mining industry IoT roles were advertised in Atlanta (United States) in the three months ending August - more than any other city. That was followed by Perth (Australia) with 11.2 per cent, Mexico City (Mexico) with 3.7 per cent, and Belo Horizonte (Brazil) with 3.4 per cent. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Methodology: GlobalData’s unique Job analytics enables understanding of hiring trends, strategies, and predictive signals across sectors, themes, companies, and geographies.
