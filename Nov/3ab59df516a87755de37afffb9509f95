Europe was the fastest growing region for robotics hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending September. The number of roles in Europe made up 22.6% of total robotics jobs – up from 0.4% in the same quarter last year. That was followed by Asia-Pacific, which saw a 15.2 year-on-year percentage point change in robotics roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include robotics, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was Hungary, which saw 0.4% of all robotics job adverts in the three months ending June last year, increasing to 14.2% in the three months ending September this year. That was followed by Japan (up 5.5 percentage points), Australia (up 3.8), and India (up 3.3). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for robotics roles in the mining industry is the United States which saw 38.7% of all roles in the three months ending September. Some 12.9% of all mining industry robotics roles were advertised in Godollo (Hungary) in the three months ending September - more than any other city. That was followed by Milwaukee (United States) with 12.9%, Mexico City (Mexico) with 5.8%, and Komatsu (Japan) with 5.3%. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Methodology: GlobalData’s unique Job analytics enables understanding of hiring trends, strategies, and predictive signals across sectors, themes, companies, and geographies.
