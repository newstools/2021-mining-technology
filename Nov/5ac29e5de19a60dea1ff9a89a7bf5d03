Asia-Pacific was the fastest growing region for Artificial Intelligence (AI) hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending September. The number of roles in Asia-Pacific made up 28.9 per cent of total AI jobs – up from 20.2 per cent in the same quarter last year. That was followed by Europe, which saw a 0.2 year-on-year percentage point change in AI roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include artificial intelligence, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was Japan, which saw 0.2 per cent of all AI job adverts in the three months ending June last year, increasing to 6.8 per cent in the three months ending September this year. That was followed by India (up 4.5 percentage points), Canada (up 0.7), and the United Kingdom (up 0.4). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for AI roles in the mining industry is the United States which saw 43.4 per cent of all roles in the three months ending September. Some 9.7 per cent of all mining industry AI roles were advertised in Milwaukee (United States) in the three months ending September - more than any other city. That was followed by Erie (United States) with 9.7 per cent, Komatsu (Japan) with 6.8 per cent, and Advance (United States) with 6.3 per cent. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Methodology: GlobalData’s unique Job analytics enables understanding of hiring trends, strategies, and predictive signals across sectors, themes, companies, and geographies.
