North America extended its dominance for cybersecurity hiring among mining industry companies in the three months ending September. The number of roles in North America made up 70.6 per cent of total cybersecurity jobs – up from 50.2 per cent in the same quarter last year. That was followed by Europe, which saw a -7.5 year-on-year percentage point change in cybersecurity roles. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The figures are compiled by GlobalData, who track the number of new job postings from key companies in various sectors over time. Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include cybersecurity, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was the United States, which saw 43.7 per cent of all cybersecurity job adverts in the three months ending June last year, increasing to 65.7 per cent in the three months ending September this year. That was followed by Australia (up 0.800000000000001 percentage points), Mexico (up 0.6), and Singapore (up 0.2). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for cybersecurity roles in the mining industry is the United States which saw 65.7 per cent of all roles in the three months ending September. Some 15 per cent of all mining industry cybersecurity roles were advertised in Peoria (United States) in the three months ending September - more than any other city. That was followed by East Peoria (United States) with 15 per cent, Chicago (United States) with 7.4 per cent, and Nashville (United States) with 5.8 per cent. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Methodology: GlobalData’s unique Job analytics enables understanding of hiring trends, strategies, and predictive signals across sectors, themes, companies, and geographies.
