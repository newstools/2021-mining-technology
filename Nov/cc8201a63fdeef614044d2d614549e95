Mentions of cybersecurity within the filings of companies in the mining industry rose 13% between the first and second quarters of 2021. In total, the frequency of sentences related to cybersecurity between July 2020 and June 2021 was 81% higher than in 2016 when GlobalData, from whom our data for this article is taken, first began to track the key issues referred to in company filings. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); When companies in the mining industry publish annual and quarterly reports, ESG reports and other filings, GlobalData analyses the text and identifies individual sentences that relate to disruptive forces facing companies in the coming years. Cybersecurity is one of these topics - companies that excel and invest in these areas are thought to be better prepared for the future business landscape and better equipped to survive unforeseen challenges. To assess whether cybersecurity is featuring more in the summaries and strategies of companies in the mining industry, two measures were calculated. Firstly, we looked at the percentage of companies which have mentioned cybersecurity at least once in filings during the past twelve months - this was 88% compared to 64% in 2016. Secondly, we calculated the percentage of total analysed sentences that referred to cybersecurity. Of the 50 biggest employers in the mining industry, Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd was the company which referred to cybersecurity the most between July 2020 and June 2021. GlobalData identified 16 cybersecurity-related sentences in the China-based company's filings - 0.4% of all sentences. Honeywell International Inc mentioned cybersecurity the second most - the issue was also referred to in 0.4% of sentences in the company's filings. Other top employers with high cybersecurity mentions included Rio Tinto, Alcoa Corp and Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd. Across all companies in the mining industry the filing published in the second quarter of 2021 which exhibited the greatest focus on cybersecurity came from Banpu PCL. Of the document's 1,031 sentences, 20 (1.9%) referred to cybersecurity. This analysis provides an approximate indication of which companies are focusing on cybersecurity and how important the issue is considered within the mining industry, but it also has limitations and should be interpreted carefully. For example, a company mentioning cybersecurity more regularly is not necessarily proof that they are utilising new techniques or prioritising the issue, nor does it indicate whether the company's ventures into cybersecurity have been successes or failures. GlobalData also categorises cybersecurity mentions by a series of subthemes. Of these subthemes, the most commonly referred to topic in the second quarter of 2021 was 'data security', which made up 57% of all cybersecurity subtheme mentions by companies in the mining industry. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Borehole Logging and Surface Geophysical Services for the Mining Industry Grinding Mills for Ores and Minerals Bearings and Units, Seals, Lubrication Systems, Remanufacturing
