A GlobalData analysis of companies in the mining industry has shed light on which companies are diversifying their revenue streams, and which are concentrating their activities in particular geographic areas or sectors. Yunnan Lincang Xinyuan Germanium Industry Co., Ltd. has been doing more than any other major player in the sector to spread its revenues out geographically, according to a GlobalData analysis of 19 key companies for whom such data is available. The spread of the company’s geographic revenue distribution rose by 162.2% between 2018 and 2020, compared to a median decrease of 3.3% for other firms in the sector. The table below shows how the ten largest companies in the mining industry are performing with regards to diversification. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The spread of PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk's revenue distribution across product categories rose by 40.2%, compared to a median increase of 2.6% for other firms in the sector. Not all major mining firms have been successfully diversifying their revenue streams, however. GlobalData's analysis of company filings shows that Tronox Holdings Plc has seen its revenues increasingly concentrated in particular geographic regions. The corporation saw its largest revenue growth between 2018 and 2020 in Latin America, which grew from 6.21% of the company's revenues to 11.42%. The largest share of Tronox Holdings Plc's revenue comes from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which accounted for 31.9% of the firm's global earnings in 2020. Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co., Ltd. has underperformed in the race to diversify earnings across different product categories. The corporation saw its largest revenue growth between 2018 and 2020 in ternary precursors, which grew from 0.06% of the company's revenues to 0.12%. The largest share of Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co., Ltd.'s revenue comes from trade and other activities, which accounted for 43.8% of the firm's global earnings in 2020. This analysis is based on GlobalData's database of over 8,000 of the world's leading companies, with a combined market capitalisation of $102 trillion and over 140 million employees. Based on data included in company filings, GlobalData calculated the normalised standard deviation (or spread) of each company's revenue streams. The standard deviation is a statistic frequently used to measure how spread out a distribution of numbers is. The data is normalised in order to ensure so that the size of a company's revenue stream does not bias the results. Since all companies divide their revenues differently, these standard deviations can't be directly compared. Instead, GlobalData analysed the direction of change for each company between 2018 and 2020. The analysis sheds light on how different companies in the mining industry are hedging against risks. The supply chain distruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have shown the importance of geographic diversification of revenues. Lockdowns, which have often been targeted at specific sectors, have similarly demonstrated the value of maintaining a diverse product offering. Product diversification among all companies examined fell by a median of 0.5%, compared to an average increase of 2.6% for the mining industry. Among all companies examined by GlobalData, geographic revenue diversification fell by an average of 0.5% between 2018 and 2020, compared to an average decrease of 3.32% for the mining industry.
