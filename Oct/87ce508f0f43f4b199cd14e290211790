Using textual analysis, these job advertisements are then classified thematically. GlobalData's thematic approach to sector activity seeks to group key company information by topic to see which companies are best placed to weather the disruptions coming to their industries. These key themes, which include environmental, social, and governance, are chosen to cover "any issue that keeps a CEO awake at night". By tracking them across job advertisements it allows us to see which companies are leading the way on specific issues and which are dragging their heels - and importantly where the market is expanding and contracting. The fastest growing country was the United States, which saw 30.9% of all ESG job adverts in the three months ending May, increasing to 35.4% in the three months ending August. That was followed by South Africa (up 2.5 percentage points), Ghana (up 1.2), and Mexico (up 0.5). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The top country for ESG roles in the mining industry is the United States which saw 35.4% of all roles in the three months ending August.
