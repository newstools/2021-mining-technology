Mentions of artificial intelligence within the filings of companies in the mining industry rose 98% between the first and second quarters of 2021. In total, the frequency of sentences related to artificial intelligence between July 2020 and June 2021 was 121% increase than in 2016 when GlobalData, from whom our data for this article is taken, first began to track the key issues referred to in company filings. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); When companies in the mining industry publish annual and quarterly reports, ESG reports and other filings, GlobalData analyses the text and identifies individual sentences that relate to disruptive forces facing companies in the coming years. Artificial intelligence is one of these topics - companies that excel and invest in these areas are thought to be better prepared for the future business landscape and better equipped to survive unforeseen challenges. To assess whether artificial intelligence is featuring more in the summaries and strategies of companies in the mining industry, two measures were calculated. Firstly, we looked at the percentage of companies which have mentioned artificial intelligence at least once in filings during the past twelve months - this was 63% compared to 50% in 2016. Secondly, we calculated the percentage of total analysed sentences that referred to artificial intelligence. Of the 50 biggest employers in the mining industry, MMC Norilsk Nickel was the company which referred to artificial intelligence the most between July 2020 and June 2021. GlobalData identified 78 artificial intelligence-related sentences in the Russia-based company's filings - 0.6% of all sentences. Severstal mentioned artificial intelligence the second most - the issue was referred to in 0.5% of sentences in the company's filings. Other top employers with high artificial intelligence mentions included Komatsu Ltd, Nippon Steel Corp and Orica Ltd. Across all companies in the mining industry the filing published in the second quarter of 2021 which exhibited the greatest focus on artificial intelligence came from MMC Norilsk Nickel. Of the document's 2,517 sentences, 26 (1%) referred to artificial intelligence. This analysis provides an approximate indication of which companies are focusing on artificial intelligence and how important the issue is considered within the mining industry, but it also has limitations and should be interpreted carefully. For example, a company mentioning artificial intelligence more regularly is not necessarily proof that they are utilising new techniques or prioritising the issue, nor does it indicate whether the company's ventures into artificial intelligence have been successes or failures. GlobalData also categorises artificial intelligence mentions by a series of subthemes. Of these subthemes, the most commonly referred to topic in the second quarter of 2021 was 'smart robots', which made up 82% of all artificial intelligence subtheme mentions by companies in the mining industry. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Africa’s Premier Supplier Of Mining Supplies Suspension and Shovel Components for the Mining Industry Innovative Mining Equipment
