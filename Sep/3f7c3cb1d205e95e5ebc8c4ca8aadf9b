Australia has announced plans to set up a $1.5bn (A$2bn) loan facility to help finance critical minerals projects in the country. The financing is expected to help secure vital resource supplies required to drive the new energy economy. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the fund would help bridge financing gaps in the development of critical minerals resources to get them off the ground. Morrison said: “The commercial dimensions of the critical minerals market mean it is a difficult place to get established. “We want to ensure that Australia’s resources producers do get established so they can link up with others in our supply chains in a free and open Indo-Pacific.” Government agency Export Finance Australia has been appointed to manage the financing facility, which would help boost the security of supply chains for critical technologies. Australia is said to have one of the world’s largest recoverable reserves of critical minerals, which are used in advanced technologies such as renewable energy, aerospace and defence. Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan said: “Australian critical minerals will help other countries in the Indo-Pacific and beyond to accelerate their industrial reforms and transition to low-carbon technologies and that benefits Australia and our partners.” Australian Resources Minister Keith Pitt said that the new facility would ensure that the country remains at the forefront of emerging opportunities in the global resources sector. The facility will operate on the National Interest Account for ten years or until the allotted financing has been provided. Earlier, the government launched the $163.3m (A$225m) Exploring for the Future Fund to support the exploration of new resources.
